## Rock! Paper! Scissors! Go! 

This Python script is written to allow for a two player game of Rock, Paper, Scissors where you can play against the computer.

## What I Learned
~ Throughout this project I learned how to utilize Conditional Logic (if, elif and else). Used the conditional statements to control the flow of the game based on the input from the user.

~ Using Logical Operators (`and`). Implemented logical operators to make decisions in the game logic.

~ Comparison Operators (`==`). Used comparison operators for determining outcomes of different choices.

## Try It!
1. Clone or download the scripts from the repo.
2. Run them in your environment (IDE / Command Line).
3. See if you can beat the computer.
4. Enjoy!
